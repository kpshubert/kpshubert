- 👋 Hi, I’m @kpshubert
- 👀 I’m interested in a large variety of architctures and platforms (this is PHP, Laravel, VueJS and MySQL)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multiple things (mostly Microsoft .Net web technologies and PHP etc, but have done some Java recently too)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... At present, I'm writing my own stuff, and haven't laid the framework down. As such, not much.
- 📫 How to reach me: Best way at present, is through email (kpshubert@kpshubert.com)
